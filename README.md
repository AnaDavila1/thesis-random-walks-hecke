# THESIS — RANDOM WALKS ON HECKE ALGEBRAS

**Code, simulations, and mathematical notes** accompanying my **MSc thesis**  
**“Hecke Algebras and Random Walks” (June 2025)**.

This repository supports the theoretical results of the thesis through
computational experiments, simulations, and auxiliary material.

## 📖 THESIS OVERVIEW

The thesis studies **random walks on the symmetric group** and their
**q-deformations via Iwahori–Hecke algebras**, with a focus on
probabilistic, algebraic, and spectral aspects.

The work combines tools from:

- Algebraic combinatorics  
- Probability on groups  
- Markov chains and mixing times  
- Hecke algebras and Coxeter theory

- Multiplication rules and q-deformations
- Connection with the symmetric group at \( q = 1 \)

### 🔹 Card Shuffling and Random Walks
- Top-to-random shuffle
- Random-to-bottom and bottom-to-random shuffles
- Random-to-random shuffle on \( S_n \)

### 🔹 Random Walks on Hecke Algebras
- q-random-to-random shuffle
- Probabilistic interpretation of Hecke algebra multiplication
- Mallows measure as stationary distribution

### 🔹 Spectral Analysis
- Reversibility and aperiodicity

## 🧮 COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT

The code in this repository includes:

- Sampling algorithms for the **Mallows measure**
- Simulation of permutation statistics (inversions, length)
- Numerical experiments illustrating convergence to stationarity
- Visualization of probability mass functions and asymptotic regimes

The simulations are designed to **illustrate and complement**
the theoretical results, not to replace them.
