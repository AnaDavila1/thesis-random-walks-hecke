# Thesis — Random Walks and Hecke Algebras

**Simulations and mathematical notes for my MSc thesis on random walks on symmetric groups, Mallows measures, and Hecke algebras.**.

This repository supports the theoretical results of the thesis through
computational experiments, simulations, and auxiliary material.

---

## 📖 Overview

The thesis studies **random walks on the symmetric group** and their
**q-deformations via Iwahori–Hecke algebras**, with a focus on
probabilistic, algebraic, and spectral aspects.

The work combines tools from:

- Algebraic combinatorics  
- Probability on groups  
- Markov chains and mixing times  
- Hecke algebras and Coxeter theory  

---

## Main topics

### Symmetric Group
- Generators and braid relations
- Reduced expressions and permutation length
- Inversion number and its combinatorial meaning

### Iwahori–Hecke Algebras
- One-parameter Hecke algebra \( H_n(q) \)
- Multiplication rules and q-deformations
- Connection with the symmetric group at \( q = 1 \)

### Card Shuffling and Random Walks
- Top-to-random shuffle
- Random-to-bottom and bottom-to-random shuffles
- Random-to-random shuffle on \( S_n \)

### Random Walks on Hecke Algebras
- q-random-to-random shuffle
- Probabilistic interpretation of Hecke algebra multiplication
- Mallows measure as stationary distribution

### Spectral Analysis
- Reversibility and aperiodicity
- Spectral gap and relaxation time
- Asymptotic behavior of \( t_{\mathrm{rel}}(q) \)
- Relation between relaxation time and mixing time

##  Simulation content

The code in this repository includes:

- Sampling algorithms for the **Mallows measure**

The simulations are designed to **illustrate and complement**
the theoretical results, not to replace them.
